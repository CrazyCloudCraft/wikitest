## About
PlaceholderAPI utilizes a .jar based module system which allows placeholders to be packaged in a .jar file and loaded/enabled dynamicly when the .jar for a specific set of placeholders is located within the `/PlaceholderAPI/expansions/` folder.  
This system offers many benefits, including, but not limited to:
- The core plugin of PlaceholderAPI is not dependent on any external resources aside from the Spigot API
- The end user can choose which expansions are loaded / enabled, reducing memory usage and/or bloat​
- If any placeholders break, the entire plugin does not break or require an update​
- It is easier for maintainability.  
Most placeholders depend on an external 3rd-party plugin to obtain data from. Sometimes those plugins update and cause the expansion or a placeholder to break.  
The developer of the expansion can update the single expansion to support the new plugin version.​
- It is easier for a developer who wants to add new placeholders to contribute​
- Updates be deployed and accessed in real time without restarting the server.​

Do you have your own expansion, that you want to share with all the PlaceholderAPI-users?
